# Using AWS Service Catalog Constraints<a name="constraints"></a>

To control which rules are applied when the end user launches a product from a specific portfolio, you apply constraints\. You apply constraints to products from the portfolio details page\. Constraints are active as soon as you create them and apply to all current versions of a product that are not already launched when you create the constraint\.
